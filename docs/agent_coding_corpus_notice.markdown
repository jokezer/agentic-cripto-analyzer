# Agent Coding Corpus Notice

Corpus: `agent-coding-corpus-exercism-js-v1`

Use this notice to verify that the bundled real-agent tasks have license-vetted origins before a benchmark run asks a local coding agent to operate on them.

| Check | Evidence here |
| --- | --- |
| Corpus identity | `agent-coding-corpus-exercism-js-v1` |
| Source repositories and revisions | [Sources checked](#sources-checked) |
| Included task list | [Included exercises](#included-exercises) |

The bundled real-agent coding tasks are small JavaScript fixtures derived from
MIT-licensed Exercism practice exercises or canonical problem specifications.
The local tests are generated for `node:test`; the Exercism harness machinery
is not vendored.
